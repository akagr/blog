I am a husband and software engineer currently helping clients succeed with amazing teams @ [Modus Create, Inc][modus].

I like reading about tech including programming (Elixir, Ruby, Javascript, Swift, Lisp), editors (Emacs, Vim, VSCode), tools (Docker, Kubernetes), frameworks (Angular, React, SwiftUI, Phoenix). I'm also found pursuing [photography][instagram], playing video games, and reading sci-fi, fantasy or exploring new genres.

Find me on [Twitter][twitter] or [Github][github].
